<h1>Climate helpers</h1>
<h2>How do you recycle and how does it help?</h2>
<p style="color:#080808">You can start by putting your rubbish in the recycling bin where possible. Did you know that most of our rubbish ends up in landfill? This is damaging our environment. All the wasted plastic is getting trapped in turtles necks. Do you want that? We are killing these animals and that is not ok.</p>
<h2>What else can you do?</h2>
<p>you can use a reusable water bottle instead of using a plastic one every time. After time that adds up to a lot of plastic wasted.You can walk or cycle to school instead of using a car. This reduces the carbon emmisions. You can also make sure that you turn of the lights in a room when your not in there.</p>
