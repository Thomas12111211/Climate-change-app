    <h2>How do you recycle and how does it help?</h2>
    <p style="color:#080808">
        You can start by putting your rubbish in the recycling bin where possible. Did you know that most of our rubbish ends up in landfill? This is damaging our environment. A lot of turtles get plastic stuck around their necks and it harms them. By recycling, you can help reduce the amount of waste that ends up in landfill and protect wildlife.
    </p>
    <h2>What else can you do?</h2>
    <p>
        You can use a reusable water bottle instead of using a plastic one every time. After time that adds up to a lot of plastic wasted. You can walk or cycle to school instead of using a car. This reduces the amount of pollution in the air and helps keep the environment clean.
