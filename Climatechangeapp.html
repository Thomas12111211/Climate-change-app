    <h2>How do you recycle and how does it help?</h2>
    <p style="color:#080808">
        You can start by putting your rubbish in the recycling bin where possible. Did you know that most of our rubbish ends up in landfill? This is damaging our environment. A lot of turtles get stuck in plastic waste, which can be fatal for them. Recycling helps to reduce the amount of waste that ends up in landfill and conserves natural resources.
    </p>
    <h2>What else can you do?</h2>
    <p>
        You can use a reusable water bottle instead of using a plastic one every time. After time that adds up to a lot of plastic wasted. You can walk or cycle to school instead of using a car. This reduces your carbon footprint and helps to keep the air cleaner. You can also encourage your friends and family to recycle and reduce waste.
