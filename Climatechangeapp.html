    <h2>How do you recycle and how does it help?</h2>
    <p style="color:#080808">
        You can start by putting your rubbish in the recycling bin where possible. Did you know that most of our rubbish ends up in landfill? This is damaging our environment. A lot of turtles get plastic bags stuck around their necks and die. Recycling helps to reduce the waste that ends up in the ocean and landfill, protecting wildlife and reducing pollution.
    </p>
    <h2>What else can you do?</h2>
    <p>
        You can use a reusable water bottle instead of using a plastic one every time. After time that adds up to a lot of plastic wasted. You can walk or cycle to school instead of using a car. This reduces carbon emissions and helps to keep the air clean. Planting trees and using renewable energy sources like solar and wind power can also make a big difference.
